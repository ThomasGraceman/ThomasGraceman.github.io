    So recently I have been reading Shinkar's paper called "On Coloring Random Subgraphs of a Fixed Graph"
    which states in an Erdős–Rényi random graph we denote by  $$ \chi(G_{1/2}) $$.
    He asks if:
    > Is there a constant $c > 0$ such that  $$E(\chi(G_{1/2})) > c \cdot \frac{\chi(G)}{\log \chi(G)}$$
    for all graphs $G$?

    You can find more in [Bukh's problem](https://thomasgraceman.github.io/2025/08/13/Bukh's-problem.html).

    Robert Robere et al. in their paper "On Pigeonhole Principles and Ramsey in TFNP" state the following open problem:
    Let t-PPP be all the total search problems reducible to t-Pigeon, namely, all the problems that the pigeonhole principle proves the existence of a solution.
    Then let PAP be the set of all problems reducible to n-PPP. So in order to further solidify their peck ordering, they ask whether Ramsey belongs (lies) in PAP or not.
    Later, when I find enough free time, I'll try to explain all the techniques of the paper in a blog post.
    Here's their paper: [On Pigeonhole Principles and Ramsey in TFNP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12604).
