    So recently i have been reading Shinkar's paper called "On Coloring Random Subgraphs of a Fixed Graph"
    which states in a erdos-renyi random graph we denote by  $$\\chi(G_{1/2})$$ he asks if > **Is there a constant $c > 0$ such that** 
>   $$E(\chi(G_{1/2})) > c \cdot \frac{\chi(G)}{\log \chi(G)}$$
>   **for all graphs $G$?** you could find more in [Bukh's problem]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.08340

  
  reward: "$ a good paper"
