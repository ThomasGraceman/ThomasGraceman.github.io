    So recently I have been reading Shinkar's paper called "On Coloring Random Subgraphs of a Fixed Graph"
    which states in an Erdős–Rényi random graph we denote by  $$\\chi(G_{1/2})$$.
    He asks if:
    > Is there a constant $c > 0$ such that  $$E(\chi(G_{1/2})) > c \cdot \frac{\chi(G)}{\log \chi(G)}$$
    for all graphs $G$?

    You can find more in [Bukh's problem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.08340).
  reward: "$ a good paper"
