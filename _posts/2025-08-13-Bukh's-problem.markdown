So, assume that we have a graph G = (V , E) by $$G_{p}$$ for some $$ p \in (0,1) $$ we mean a subgraph such that the 
probibility of each edge appearing in that subgraph is independent with probability p. now that we have the defination set
the main motive of shinkar's ppaer `On Coloring Random Subgraphs of a Fixed Graph`, is to study the $$ \chi(G_{1/2}) $$ the coloring number
of the subgraph that we randomly get by removing each edge with the probibility of 1/2. 

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
